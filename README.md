# Quiz 5 - 6

## 

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - **Dataset Import:** The earthquake dataset is imported and initial analysis is performed to handle missing values and outliers.
   - **Data Cleaning:** Cleaning involves removing or imputing missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring data integrity.

2. **Data Analysis**
   - **Magnitude Analysis:** Analyzing earthquake magnitudes to understand their distribution and trends over time.
   - **Depth Analysis:** Exploring the depths of earthquakes and their correlation with other factors.
   - **Geographical Distribution:** Visualizing earthquake occurrences on a map to identify high-seismic zones.

3. **Data Transformation**
   - **Data Reshaping:** Using techniques like stacking and unstacking to reshape data for better analysis of various earthquake parameters.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - **Trend Visualization:** Creating line charts and time series plots to visualize earthquake trends over time.
   - **Distribution Visualization:** Using bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms to visualize magnitude distributions and depth variations.

5. **Yearly Aggregation**
   - **Yearly Trends:** Aggregating earthquake data on a yearly basis to identify recurring patterns and seasonal variations.

## Tools Used

- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Data Source:** Earthquake dataset (provided in CSV format)
